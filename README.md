Check the classification of two and three dimensional reflexive polytopes for those that are structurally unstable

Structural stability was introduced in [arxiv link] as a means to study the non-solvability of a type of real Monge ampere equation
on singular affine manifolds related to reflexive polytopes. 

The result of which reflexive polytopes that are structurally stable is contained in structural_stability_d1.txt and structural_stability_d2.txt respectively. The script structStabRef.py prints these. Changing dimension amount to setting the variable 'n' in the script.
